      <p>Beehive Chicken is a rich fantastic blend of Dixie Jazz, Southern Rock, Country, and Classic Rock.  A sound so awesome that it makes even Canadians pretend to be Southern.  </p>

      <p>It has been a great year for Beehive Chicken.</p> 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <p>2019 marks the year that Beehive Chicken grew out of its cage and started touring.  We have been all over the East Coast this year.  Were you there in 2018 when we all gathered in the small town of Chateaugay, NY?  It may have been a solemn occasion, but it was the start of a beautiful new road.  New relationships were formed.  Old relationships were renewed.  Much food was consumed.  </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Don’t tell anyone, but we have news.   We have a new member joining the band.  Gregory the Loud will be appearing with us for the first time at our big Christmas special in Benson, NC.  We have seen him perform.  Believe us when we say that Gregory knows how to make noise with whatever happens to be in the room.  Just don’t let that boy drive.   His skills need work.
