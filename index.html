      <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 40px; color: green " >Beehive Chicken is a rich fantastic blend of Dixie Jazz, Southern Rock, Country, and Classic Rock.  A sound so awesome that it makes even Canadians pretend to be Southern.  </p>

      <p>Well, we have a goat back at the ranch where we rehearse.  &nbsp;Oh sure, the young ladies think he is SOOOO cute.  &nbsp;In reality, Whisky is willing to try eating anything he isn't trying to headbutt.  One day ol'Whiskey headbutted the wrong member of our staff.  Not only did it result in a two minute melee we wished we had captured on video. &nbsp;However, now there is a song about Whiskey. </p>
      <p>"Play stupid games. &nbsp;Win stupid prizes." </p>

      <p>Were you there in 2018 when we all gathered in the small town of Chateaugay, NY?</p> 
      <p>It may have been a solemn occasion, but it was the start of a beautiful new chapter. &nbsp;New relationships were formed.  &nbsp;Old relationships were renewed.  &nbsp;Much food was consumed.  </p>

      <p>Don’t tell anyone, but we have news.</p>
      <p>We have a new member joining the band.  &nbsp;Gregory "the climber" will be appearing with us for the first time at our big Christmas special in Benson, NC.</p>
      <p>We have seen him perform.  &nbsp;Believe us when we say that Gregory knows how to make noise with whatever happens to be in the room.</p>
      <p>Just don’t let that boy drive.   &nbsp;His skills need work.</P>
