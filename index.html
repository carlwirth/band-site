      <p>Well, we have a goat back at the ranch where we rehearse.  Oh sure, the young ladies think he is SOOOO cute.  In reality, Whisky is willing to try eating anything he isn't trying to headbutt.  One day ol'Whiskey headbutted the wrong member of our staff.  Not only did it result in a two minute melee we wished we had captured on video, but now there is a song about Whiskey. </p>

      <p>Don’t tell anyone, but we have news.</p>
      <p>We have a new member joining the band.  Gregory "the climber" will be appearing with us for the first time at our big Christmas special in Benson, NC.</p>
      <p>We have seen him perform.  Believe us when we say that Gregory knows how to make noise with whatever happens to be in the room.</p>
      <p>Just don’t let that boy drive.   His skills need work.</P>
